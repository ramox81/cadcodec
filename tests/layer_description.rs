//! A layer's description survives a round-trip.
//!
//! The format keeps it in the layer's extended data under the
//! `AcAecLayerStandard` application, as two strings of which the second is the
//! text -- the same place, and on DWG the same mechanism, the layer
//! transparency comes from. Until now it was parsed and dropped on both
//! readers, so a description was invisible to every caller.
//!
//! The fixtures are written by the crate itself: no sample drawing is needed
//! and none is referenced.
